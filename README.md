# AR-Dice
Simple and fun to use iOS app made to make Augmented reality (AR) be in our daily life or at least a part of it.In this version of the app the dice which we tend to lose very easily is replaced by an AR dice which always stays in our pocket forever.

# How to use 
- Point the iPhone's camera on a horizontal surface.(Through view finder)
- The app will automatically detect a horizontal plane and will place a horizontal grid on the surface.
- So, yeah you're good to go. That was it.
- Touch inside the grid and you'll get an AR Die with every tap.
